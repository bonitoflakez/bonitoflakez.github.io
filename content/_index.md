I'm Nikhil, a CS Student and a Full-Stack Web Developer from India. I'm not picky about what I work with; I dive into anything that gets the job done. I love crafting automation scripts and websites that make life easier, whether it's through my trusty terminal or just a couple of clicks.

As I'm still a student I sometimes work as a freelancer. If I'm not working on any freelance project then I often spend my time working on personal projects, or trying out new technologies I find interesting. Besides that I also read books, annoy my cats, study psychology for fun (it's just a random subject I'm interested in).

As the tech industry is moving forward to new and inovative stuff I'm trying to learn and maintain the old-school ways of programming along with the new trends. I'm currently learning about systems programming. Playing around with C and Assembly language to get a more indepth knowledge of how everything works. I'm not a god-like programmer I just love learning new things from time to time to keep myself updated to new things.

Also, I LOVE listening to music I listen to music like 80% of the time.
